## Introduction to IP

If you want to move something between two addresses, It will be very common to use loading trucks. Load the items into the back of loading trucks and driving to the new address and then unload the items.

Basically Network works as same way. 
We will move data inside of moving trucks, across the network, and then unload them on the other land. 
Network can be regarded as road, like ethernet network or DSL network, or Cable modem. 
Inside of this truck, it includes data, which our trucks act like Internet protocol. 
It has responsible for responding data, one in the network and moving it to other land of network.
The boxes hold your data. 
The boxes of data usually a TCP box or UDP of data.  

<br>
Highway really doesn't care what types of trucks are driving on it. -> Ethernet, DSL, cable system network. 
<br>
The truck does really care what holding in their back. The goal is to get things place on the right place.  -> IP
<br>
People who loads and unlodas the boxes from trucks doesn't care what is inside ot the boxes as long as they can unload it on the other land.

## IP(Internet Protocol)

![Image ip protocol](https://infosys.beckhoff.com/content/1033/fbb-x900/images/Ethernet%20protocol.gif)
Ethernet header(client)- At the begining of data
Ethernet playload(pathway);transporing IP address traffic, IP playload
Ethernet trailer(server) - The end of Ethernet tailer

We konw IP playload(boxes) have two types of TCP or UDP data. 
TCP will have TCP playload. Good example of TCP data is HTTP data or web browsing data. 

To send http data through network, we need to be encapsulated it first with TCP.
After then, TCP should be encapuslated within IP, which is then encapulated in Ethernet.

## TCP and UDP
Transported inside of IP and Encapsulated by the IP protocol

Some applications might be better using TCP protocol. Other applications might be better if they use UDP protocol.

TCP and UDP operates at the OSI model layer 4.

<br>
We will look OSI model in later more details.
If someone say "OSI layer 4", then It referes either TCP or UDP.

TCP and UDP have strong benefits that allow us to use multiple applications at the same time across the network. 

TCP(Transmission Contorl Protocol)
TCP is an example of a connection-oriented protocol becuase there is formal connection made with separated devices on the network. 
It requires a logical connection to be established between the two processes before data is exchanged. The connection must be maintained during the entire time that communication is taking place, then released afterward. 

If you google the "TCP", then it is described as like following:
![](https://www.colocationamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/udp-tcp.jpg)

We said TCP needs the logical connection between devices. 
TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish a reliable connection.

The connection is full duplex, and both sides synchronize (SYN) and acknowledge (ACK) each other. The exchange of these four flags is performed in three steps—SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK-
![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9781597499613000030-f03-08-9781597499613.jpg?_)

The client chooses an initial sequence number, set in the first SYN packet. The server also chooses its own initial sequence number, set in the SYN/ACK packet. Each side acknowledges each other's sequence number by incrementing it; this is the acknowledgement number. The use of sequence and acknowledgment numbers allows both sides to detect missing or out-of-order segments.

Once a connection is established, ACKs typically follow for each segment. The connection will eventually end with a RST (reset or tear down the connection) or FIN (gracefully end the connection).

[More details in here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/three-way-handshake#:~:text=The%20TCP%20handshake,as%20shown%20in%20Figure%203.8.)

We also say TCP is reliable mode of communication. Whenever we send data to another device, we expect to receive data at ACKs back from that devices. There is strong evidence that communication has made. That is why we are able to trace where the data flow through the communication. Therefore, if the data is lost during communication, we can retransmission messages. This property is "Realiable".
In addition, within TCP, the receiver can manage how much data is sent, which means server side can control the speed of communication. This property is "Control Flow".

 (Data is transferred and then that data is terminated at the end of that communication.
Every time you need send it. 
여기서 TCP와 HTTP를 연관지어 헤깔렸다. TCP에 encapsulated된 정보가 대개 HTTP라고 해서, HTTP의 stateless특징이 TCP에서 비롯되었다고 생각했다. 
그런데 이는 다른 것이다. TCP는 request/respose가 되었다는 정보만 나타낸다. 즉, 데이터(박스)가 있다 없다만 판별한다면, 그 박스를 어떻게 열고 닫는지, 어떤 정보가 
들어있는지 instruction이 바로 HTTP이다. 우리가 header에 post/get method를 명시하거나, Json object data를 body에 넣어 보내거나, header에 key값을 넣어
보내는 것이 바로 이런 것이다. 즉, HTTP의 stateless는 HTTP만의 특성이고 TCP는 다르다. 오히려 TCP는 stateful connection이라서 session이 client, server에 저장되어있다. stateless를 쓰는 이유는 server측에서 정보를 저장하고 있을 필요가 없으니 server design이 간단해 진다. 
You can understand why HTTP is stateless. Each request is executed independently, without knowing of the requests that were executed before it.)
