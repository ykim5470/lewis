Generally, if someone googles about 'How to become a data scientist', There are a lot of blogs which straight away go into skills
and technologies relevant to Data Science world. This is what inspired me to write about the roadmap to follow. 
<br>
<br>

Following picture dicates the roadmap one shoule follow to become Data Scientist.

    Mathematics topics for Data Science
  </font>
<p>


<br>
Mathematics is the backbone of Data Science. You would have heard people saying the ML/DL models are like black box.
However they are not. It is just that we haven't put enough efforts to understand the maths under the hood. 
One doesn't need to become master of maths in order to start their career in Data Science, but if you are good with math then you will be playboy of Data Science world. Spend 2-3 days, just to get comfortable with the topics mentioned below. 
<br>

<h4>Few use-cases to motivated:</h4>

<table>
  <li>Straight Line Geometry and Matrix Operations used in Linear Regression.
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Sigmoid Function is the backbone of Logistic regression. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Differential calculus is the backbone of Backpropagation which is the foundation of any Deep Learning Algorithms.
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Eigen Values/Vectors is must to understand Principal Component Analysis which is a very popular Dimensionality Reduction Technique.
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Gradient Descent utilises differential calculus as well as Optimisation of cost function.
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Permutation and Combination is used to get understanding of propability which is must for Bayes Theorem and Naive Bayes Model. 
  <br>
  <br>


<h3>Programming Lanuages:</h3>

More than 250+ langauges are out there in the market. Choosing which language to learn is quite difficult. Generally, Data enthusiasts gets confused between R and Python. In order to decide on the language, Let’s look at the survey done by Analytics India Magazine in 2019. It tells the preferred programming language by recruiters.

    Recruiters preferred Programming language

<p>

<section>
As it clearly says, the demand for Python professionals is the highest among all analytics recruiters. Almost 17% of all advertised analytics jobs in India demand for Python as a core skill whereas 16% demand Java. 8 out of 10 data scientists would recommend Python as the prime language. Python is easy to learn and widely-accepted programming language.
So, I hope now you would have made your mind to start with Python.

    Types of Statistical Analysis
  </font>
<p>


<section>
I had wondered that "Why do we need to learn statistics in Data Science?" <br>The simple answer was -- To Survive. One may get the job without knowing about statistics, but then you will get raped for your entire data science journey. (Resemble to a dialogue in 3 idiots).
</section>

<br>
<section>
There are 5 types of statistical analysis. Four of them with topics are highlighted in the above image. The image above serves as a guide for my students in learning Statistics. Fifth type of Statistical Analysis which is not in the image — Predictive Statistical Analysis which covers predictive modelling techniques like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Generalised Linear models.

<section>
Data wrangling is the process of transforming and mapping data from one raw data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics. Here I have combined multiple Data Wrangling steps intop groups on which success of any Data Analytics / Science project depends.
</section>
<br>

<br>
<section>
As rightly said — <strong>“A picture is worth a thousand words”.</strong> In Data Science, this is worth billion dollar. No one can call oneself as Data Scientist until he/she is good with visualization. Data visualization and dashboard design are both art and science and not as easy to create as they may first appear. One should know about visualisation techniques and more importantly where to use which one. Visualization helps in making story out of data. A lot of organisation (can’t tell the name) has made billions by impressing clients just by Data Visualization.

    Machine Learning — Supervised and Unsupervised
  </font>
<p>

<br>
<section>
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to perform a task without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine Learning is the brain of Robots like Sophia. When it comes to machine learning, People jump directly to algorithms and implement them without knowing backend of the algorithms. Implementing ML model is not a big task, people have already written codes for you and within 5 lines of code you will be able to implement and evaluate any ml algorithm. But that’s not the goal. Here goal is to implement them right. For example: I have seen Data experts interpreting results of Linear regression without performing residual analysis and goodness of fit test.

   Data Science Competition
  </font>
<p>

<section>
Data Science is more art than science. Best way to learn Data Science is by doing it. There are lots of platform which host data science competitions to build a better world, bringing cutting-edge predictive models to organizations tackling the world’s toughest problems. Lot of companies internally conduct such competitions to bring competitive and learning culture. I literally ask my students to participate in the competitions in the class and submit the solution to give them motivation. It also helps them develop business acumen, and improve their technical skills at the same time.
</section>
<br>

Here I have listed few of them:
<li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>
<li><a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/">Analytics Vidhya</a>
<li><a href ="https://www.drivendata.org/">Data Driven</a>

<h3>Resume Creation and Interview Preparation</h3>



At this point, if one has completed above topics religiously, He/She is literally ready to become Data Analyst ( not Data Scientist :-) ). One can start to create resume and prepare for interviews. There are lot of blogs which can help you create a good resume, Here are few important points while creating resume:
<br>
<br>

<li>
Before start creating resume, put yourself in the employer’s shoes and think what kind of guy they are looking. For example: Are they looking for more technical guy or consulting guy or managerial guy? This will help you to know what kind of words one has to use in the resume.
